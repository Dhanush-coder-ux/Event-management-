    <p><h1>My favourite event is the Annual Function. It is organised in the month of September in my school. This year I participated in Drama. The event name was “The Mirage”. It told the story of a Fisherman and his greedy wife. I played the role of a Golden Mermaid. On that day, our teachers asked us to do makeup at home and then come to school.
